# Bank
So everything is in the master branch 


So far u can:
-Register and get unique account number
-Log in 
-Add money 
-Subtract money
-Check for account balance


In the next versions:
- I'm planning to add transfers between accounts (at this moment locally but who know maybe someday)
- Change app profile to client/server
- Later later on add GUI


Cheers
